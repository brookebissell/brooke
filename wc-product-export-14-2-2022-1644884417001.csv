No chemicals or preservatives just simple human grade ingredients baked in small batches to ensure quality. ABOUT OUR BISCUITS: Made with quality human-grade natural ingredients Made in a commercial grade kitchen in small batches to ensure quality and safety Made with gluten free oat flour No soy, wheat or corn Our fresh baked biscuits come in 7 oz bags in the following flavors: Peanut butter and coconut The Elvis-Peanut butter, banana and bacon Pumpkin Chia Blueberry Because there are no chemicals or preservatives we bake our biscuits to remove as much moisture as possible to extend the shelf life.

Use by date on each package. ABOUT US: Our passion is our dogs and we started making biscuits as a way to show love for our beloved senior pug, Milo who was diagnosed in 2015 with mast cell cancer. Strongly believing that what you feed your dog makes a big difference in their health, we set out to switch his diet to healthy human grade ingredients and that included his treats.
